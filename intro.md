## Intro

I'm not a man of many words.

This book is titled "Understanding SEO", it offers a model of - a way to think about - SEO (Search Engine Optimization).

If you want to apply SEO to your existing or future business, this book is for you. 

If you want to seperate the value creating parts of SEO from the bullshit that SEO blogs shove down the throat of businesses on a daily basis, this book is for you.

If you see SEO as your responsibility, and not the responsiblity of an overpaid "SEO agency", this book is for you.

If you want to know the latest "secret SEO tips'n tricks" to do the "the Art of SEO", then this book is definitly not for you.

This book is also not titled "Understanding Google" or "Understanding Search Engines". Search Engines - which means in all western markets "Google" - are an essential part of SEO, they are the marketplace we are dealing with, but it is not the goal of SEO (and not the goal of this book) to "reverse engineer" Google.

To get the most out of this book you need to have a basic understanding about the internet and how the internet works. If i say "H1" then you know that i mean the `<h1>`-headline one HTML tag. If i say "server" you know that i mean the software/hardware combination that is used to deliver webpages to the browsers of the users (or other clients). If i say "Google" you know that i mean the dominant search engine for all western markets.

This is not a beginners book.
